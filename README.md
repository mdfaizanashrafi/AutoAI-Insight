🚀 AutoAI Insight: A Smart Automated Machine Learning & Insights Platform
AutoAI Insight is an end-to-end AutoML platform built as a capstone project that synthesizes all concepts covered in Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow (3rd Edition) by Aurélien Géron.

From raw data to deployed intelligent models — structured, image, and text — with real-time insights, explainability, and continuous learning.

🎯 Project Objective:
To develop a full-featured, extensible, and production-ready AutoML system that can:

✅ Analyze structured, textual, and visual datasets

✅ Perform classification, regression, clustering, and anomaly detection

✅ Explain predictions using visualizations and interpretable models

✅ Deploy models via REST APIs and Web UIs

✅ Monitor performance, detect drift, and trigger retraining
